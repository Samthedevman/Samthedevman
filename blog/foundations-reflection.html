      <h2>Foundations Reflection</h2>
      <h3>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I learned that I can code things, even without knowing how, just being
        able to use my problem solving skills and the internet. During the
        whackamole stretch material, I had no idea how to do a timer, but
        through some research and perverance I was able to get it going...Really
        showed me that I can do alot if I just keep pushing. Bringing me to my
        next point, during the neuroplasticity and growth mindset learning, I
        learned that anything is possible to a point, I can learn and gain new
        skills, it just requires attention, effort and willingness, it was a
        real eye opener. And my last point being I shouldn't be so hard on
        myself, its okay to not know something, its just something I haven't
        learned yet. I thing being tough on ones self is good to a certain
        degree, but you got to sit back and take note of it, and make sure that
        it isn't stopping you from pursuing something.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think for programming all these things are important. As a programmer
        you work with others, being a good team player is definitely something
        that will help achieve results, having empathy for others and seeing
        their point of view, ultimately will come together to form a better
        result. Values like contribution, courage are things we have learned
        during foundations, and taught how important they can be for coding.
        Being self aware of your emotions is definitely a must when it comes to
        learning code, concepts get complicated and coming back to that point of
        having a growth mindset, really helps cool those imposter syndrome
        thoughts.
      </p>

      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        I will be honest, when it came to the core learnings, at first I was
        just in my head, I want to code, teach me code...it wasen't until maybe
        the second or third core learning, that I realised how valuable the
        content is and the more I've been coding the more I realised how
        relevent they are to learning and becoming a developer.
      </p>
      <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        I am a perfectionist so I would say keeping within the time boxes set
        out. Some of the core learnings, you had to be self critical, take note
        of your strengths and weaknesses and how they could impact you going
        forward. It wasent so much challenging but more eye opening, and then
        writing about it, getting the thoughts to paper/keyboard, is what I
        found time consuming and a little challenging aswell as having to do
        some self analysis. Knowing that others will be reading it also made me
        want to write well.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I would say because it is relevent. I can see why it is a massive part
        of foundations before the bootcamp kicks off. All the content is
        important for the career of a developer, and it touches on alot of the
        aspects of cooperation, mindset, emotional awareness just to name a few.
        All relevent content someone needs to know to become a good developer,
        training in things that dev teams in the workforce want.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h3>
      <p>
        My initial thoughts were yes, but soon after I realised its relevence
        and importance so its a big no from me. The growth mindset stuff I found
        very empowering, content that I needed to hear again even though I
        already had a rough idea on it. I thought the entire foundations was a
        good balance of coding, and core learnings that benefit developers and
        helps create great developers.
