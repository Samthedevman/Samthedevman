      <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
      <h3>Blocked on a simple problem...</h3>

      <p>
        So during some coding Kata's back at Dev Academy(think of it as code
        training questions to help build skills), we had to add each student
        from an array(an array is a varible that holds a list of data) to a
        property of the gradebook(gradebook is an object, inside an object you
        can have key(property) and value(property type) pairs). I started this
        question with a for loop
        <a
          href="../blog/javascript-dom.html"
          target="_blank"
          style="text-decoration: underline"
          >(click here if you need a refresher on loops, arrays and objects)</a
        >
        as I knew we had to go through each student in the array, but we had to
        add them to the gradebook as a empty object, which to be honest I was
        pretty stumped on and I struggled with the syntax for adding them as an
        empty object. Still trying to get my head around the syntax after the
        loop to give me my desired result, I really had to google a lot for this
        question and used a bracket notation for the end result which I have not
        really used before.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the moment, like this question, it sounds easy and it feels like the
        solution wouldn't be that hard, but it can get a bit frustrating trying
        to find the answer, especially if it is new syntax you don't know how to
        do. Overall though, I learned about object bracket notation due to
        googling how to solve this which I did not really know about before this
        exercise. I'm still unsure if the question could be solved without
        bracket notation...
      </p>
      <h3>Elegantly solved a problem...</h3>
      <p>
        Fizzbuzz. The solution sounded like a simple conditional statement from
        the beginning <a
        href="../blog/javascript-dom.html"
        target="_blank"
        style="text-decoration: underline"
        >(click here and have a read of the first paragraph under control flow if you need a refresher on conditional statements)</a
      > The question was to fill in a function <a
      href="../blog/javascript-dom.html"
      target="_blank"
      style="text-decoration: underline"
      >(click here if you want a refresher on functions)</a
    > that takes a
        number as a parameter, then if that number can be divided by 15
        return a string, if it can be divided by 3 return a different string, if
        can be divided by 5 return a different string, otherwise just return the
        number. I knew this statement required a % from my past experience
        learning conditional statements, cause if something divided by 3 is
        perfect, the remainder should equal 0. I wrote the conditional statement
        near correct from the start but completely out of order. Reviewing the
        testing results, I realised it must be in a certain order and the
        adjusted the statement to suit.
      </p>

      <p>
        I felt confident throughout the process but was questioning why my first
        result was not working then I realised after reviewing the test results.
        I learned how useful tests can be, they act as a guide for the most
        part, and also this question reaffirmed the difference between equal to
        (==) and strict equal to(===) for me, the latter being equal value and
        type, since we are comparing numbers, either one can be used for this
        statement.

        Pseudocode is something I am really putting effort into trying to learn
        more after finishing the katas. I felt my pseudocode throughout the
        exercises was lacking, I felt I was just repeating the question asked
        and not breaking it down fully, I feel this comes with practice though
        and it is still very new to me. This is something I am trying to
        practice and truely implement in my problem solving going forward. I
        know the learning process is to break things into small steps, this
        applies even to something as small as a function and pseudocode is a
        strength for this. This reminds me of my mindset blog, and one of my new
        favourite sayings "practice makes permanent". I am trying some online
        challenges like the katas to try and get this down more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rubber ducky method, I wrote this down and stuck it on my wall above
        Master Chief...
      </p>
      <img
        src="../blogcontent/chief.jpeg"
        style="height: auto; width: 20vw; text-align: center"
      />
      <p>
        (surely if Chief can save humanity from the covenant he can help me
        solve some coding questions). Well this is something else I need to
        practice more, instead of just jumping straight into google, it also
        brings me back to pseudocode and going through steps to get to the end
        solution. I need to rely on chief and my own logical thinking a bit more
        before jumping to google.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel confident with console logging and error messages. They give you
        clear hints on where syntax may be wrong, what line, or how a variable
        has already been defined, undefined etc. Google, I feel like google is a
        coders saviour. It helps when it comes to writing the syntax for
        solutions, and also gives insight into possible solutions, I feel like
        most people my age are good at using google. For coding questions, its
        much more helpful searching for the solution in small steps, eg how to
        split a string into an array, then searching and learning how to use
        .map on that array you just split. Overall I feel good using google.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did not ask for help from my peers or coaches during the katas, I did
        not feel the need to came about but I know it's there if I need it. I
        will say it feels good when you're able to aid someone else and help fix
        a problem or answer a question they may have. The katas were challenging
        I will say, I would try write out a solution before hitting up google
        but most of them sort felt like i was on the right track but my syntax
        was wrong, and even after googling and changing my solution to what I
        thought would work, it would still fail. Trial and error is part of the
        problem solving journey I feel, and keeping that growth mindset, knowing
        that it's just something I have not fully learnt yet helps. Reflection
        is something I need to implement more, I can't say I reflect on a
        process after it has been completed or during that much. I feel this
        reflection right now, in a way is helping me see my strengths and
        weaknesses when it comes to coding and problem solving, and has
        definitely opened my eyes a bit when it comes to my process.
