      <h2>JS Fundamentals</h2>
      <h3>
        An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.
      </h3>
      <p>
        For this im going to use the classic building analogy and not because
        everyone else does, but because I think personally most people come to
        think of this analogy when they first encounter all 3 of these
        languages, I know I did. Most websites are made up of Html, Css and
        Javascript. Lets first talk about each one. Html stands for Hypertext
        Markup Language, think of html as the building structure, how many
        bedrooms, how many floors etc. It is the structure of a website, or in
        this case the building. Css stands for Cascading Style Sheet. Style,
        buildings can have style right. What fancy coloured bricks does the
        building have, does it even have bricks, maybe its all just glass...see
        where im going with this. Css is how we style an html page, give it its
        nice wallpapers, fonts etc. Now Javascript, how does it relate to Html
        and Css. Javascript controls the functionality of a website, or in this
        case the building. Like turning the lights on in the building so you can
        see at night. Clicking a button that then changes the website to dark
        mode, thats all controlled by Javascript. Javascript has the ability to
        interact with Html and Css and manipulate there code all from a click of
        a button.
      </p>
      <h3>Control flow and Loops</h3>
      <p>
        Control flow is the order in which code executes. This is true for
        Javascript, Html and Css, hence the reason Css stands for cascading
        style sheets, as the code trickles down and is executed from top to
        bottom. There are lines of code that can change the flow, statements
        like functions, conditionals and loops are just some examples.
        Conditionals are statements which are executed only if the outcome reads
        true, otherwise the next line of code is run. For example. You wake up
        and go to make a coffee in the morning, do you like milk in your coffee
        and is it available? If yes, then make a coffee with milk. But let’s say
        there isn’t any milk. Are there alternatives. This is how a condition
        statement reads back. If there is no milk, but you still like coffee
        even without milk, then make a coffee without milk and if that isn’t the
        case and you absolutely cannot have coffee without milk, then maybe the
        last line of code for this statement in this analogy would be to go and
        get some or don’t have a coffee at all. Statements like conditionals are
        determined like this, if the first result does not equal true, it flows
        down until the result can be finalised.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loops are a bit different. They loop over code over and over as long as
        the result is true, and keep looping until there is nothing left to loop
        over or if the condition becomes false. Say you have a nice full water
        bottle for you to drink from throughout the day, this would be the start
        of the loop. You continually take sips from this water throughout the
        day because there is still water in the bottle available and you’re a
        thirsty human who likes to make sure you stay hydrated. It’s only when
        the bottle is full depleted of water, that you cannot take any more sips
        from it that the loop will finally come to an end.
      </p>
      <h3>What the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it</h3>
      <p>
        The DOM stands for document object model. It is an object model and
        programming interface. For programming languages like Javascript, to
        exist and function, there must be some sort of structure for it to
        manipulate, the DOM is that structure and it allows us to then use
        Javascript to add/remove and change elements and many more cool things.
        The DOM structure of an html page can be laid out like a tree.
      </p>
      <img id="boxModelImage" src="../blogcontent/DOM.jpeg" />
      <p>
        This tree like structure is what javascript plays with. Lets go over an
        example of how Javascript can manipulate the dom.
      </p>
      <img id="boxModelImage" src="../blogcontent/DOM HTML EXAMPLE.png" />
      <img id="boxModelImage" src="../blogcontent/THE DOM EXAMPLE 2.png" />
      <p>
        The code in the above image is for a simple heading in an HTML page
        saying Hello World as you can see in the image beside it, aswell as a
        button called Change to Hello User. This button is connected to the
        heading through Javascript with its ability to manipulate the DOM and is
        ready to manipulate the inner text of the heading with a simple click of
        the button. Lets look at the Javascript code below and what the heading
        will look like after we click the button.
      </p>
      <img id="boxModelImage" src="../blogcontent/DOM JS EXAMPLE.png" />
      <img id="boxModelImage" src="../blogcontent/THE DOM EXAMPLE 1.png" />
      <p>
        What is this Javascript code doing exactly. First its grabbing the
        button in html by its id(refer html code in the previous example) and
        storing it as a variable called button. The javascript in the next line
        of code below has an event listener attached to the variable button. The
        javascript is now listening for a click of the button to then initiate a
        function that will change the inner text of the heading. After a user
        clicks the button, the heading text is changed from Hello World to Hello
        User as you can see in the picture beside it. This is just a simple
        example how how Javascript can interact with the DOM. It adds user
        interaction to a page through such coding. This leads us to the next
        question below
      </p>
      <h3>What functions are and why they are helpful.</h3>
      <p>
        Functions are a block of code that performs a task. Once a function has
        been made, it can be called whenever a programmer needs it. In the
        example above we used a function to perform the task of changing the
        inner text of the heading. This function was made within the event
        listener so it is only relevent to that particular event. Functions can
        be made and called outside of this though. Functions can be written to
        take inputs aka parameters. The function can then use these parameters
        for executing the code. Lets take a look at a function below.
      </p>
      <img id="boxModelImage" src="../blogcontent/JS FUNCTION EXAMPLE.png" />
      <p>
        In this example the function is created and called addNumbersTogether
        and within the () it takes in two parameters a and b. Within the
        function, the content within the curly braces {} this is what the
        function is going to do, its going to return to us the value of a and b
        added together. Now that the function has been defined, it must be
        called. For this we are using the console.log. If you want to learn more
        about what console.log click
        <a
          style="color: greenyellow"
          href="https://www.programiz.com/javascript/console"
          >HERE</a
        >
        and have a read. We are using this method just to call our function to
        see it do its magic. Now we are simply calling the function by its name
        addNumbersTogether() and as you can see within the () we have added in
        our parameters for a and b which in this case are the numbers 100 and 9.
        The end result for this function is then shown at the bottom. A very
        basic example. I used console.log for this example just to show the
        function in action. If we wanted to call this function within our
        javascript we would simply just need to write addNumbersTogether(100,
        9). Lastly, functions do not need to have parameters, they are entirely
        optional depending on what the programmer needs the function to do.
      </p>
      <h3>The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
      <p>
        Arrays and objects both store data. Arrays store a list of values which
        can be changed. Objects store more of a collection of data, not just
        single values. Objects can also be changed to. Have a look below at the
        array(top) and the object(bottom).
      </p>
      <img id="boxModelImage" src="../blogcontent/OBJEXAMPLE.png" />
      <p>
        Arrays are a way to store multiple data types in a variable. They can be
        more then just string values like in the example above, they can also be
        numbers, booleans, objects and even arrays within an array which is
        pretty cool to think about. Arrays use indexing starting the count at 0.
        For this example if we wanted to access the first value in the array
        wishListHolidaySpots we would have to declare the variable and follow it
        with the index number of the value we want to access, so to access
        Greece we would write wishListHolidaySpots[0]. When we are using the
        square brackets [], we are telling javascript what value in the array we
        wish to access. If we wanted Spain we would use index [2].
      </p>
      <p>
        Objects are ways to represent something in code. They have a key and a
        value, those are there true names but you can think of it like a
        property of that object and a type of the property. They are different
        from arrays as they do not use indexing, just key and value pairs. In
        this example we have the object person, with a key of occupation and a
        value of student. If we wanted to access the persons occupation we would
        simply use dot notation. For this example, its person.occupation.
