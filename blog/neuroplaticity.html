      <h3>
        Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
        people.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is the brains ability to reorganise itself and adapt to
        changes. Studys have shown that those who have been taught this
        understanding have been able to excel much more than the individuals who
        have not. Someone who understands neuroplasticity really knows how new
        things are learned, understands that practise makes permanent, that
        learning a new skill, in turn is helping strengthen the connections in
        the brain which is going to help the individual get better at that
        skill. Overall, the benefit is understanding that they can get
        smarter/better at anything if they just work at it.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for
        your benefit.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Definitely adopting a new way of thinking when approaching tasks and
        learning in general. Understanding that repetition, practice makes
        permanent is going to help me develop new skills as it will build and
        strengthen connections and understanding that when you don't practice
        for an extended period that pathway will get weaker overtime.
        Understanding that difficultly is good, and it's going to help me
        develop my skills. Constantly learning something new and building on
        concepts which are already down will help strengthen the old and new
        concepts even more. Engaging in interference, and only putting infront
        of me habits that are going to be beneficial.
      </p>
      <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Exercising, due to its ability to increase blood flow and cell growth
        </li>
        <li>Practicing mindfulness to help decrease stress and boost mood</li>
        <li>
          Making sure I am taking care of myself, getting enough sleep, staying
          hydrated and eating well
        </li>
        <li>
          Practicing coding, the use of problem solving skills and reinforcing
          my memory will help me improve
        </li>
        <li>Keep on playing Chess</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
      <p>
        It's understanding that your skills can be developed through practice,
        solid effort and constantly pushing forward in the face of setbacks.
        Knowing that intelligence is not a fixed trait, anyone can get smarter
        they just need to put in the effort. It's very relevant due to the fact
        that success is linked to this understanding. Having this mindset is
        going to help you develop new skills because it drives home the
        importance of practice and determination. Knowing you can develop your
        skills and IQ will help you be more successful in life.
      </p>
      <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
      <p>
        I had heard about growth mindset before but did not really know much
        about it or thought it might be helpful. This exploration kinda opened
        my eyes a bit as to how successful people are bound to have this
        mindset, because it is needed in the face of constant obstacles and for
        learning/developing new skills and constantly pushing forward.
      </p>
      <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
      <p>
        Definitely adopting a growth mindset and not engaging in self criticism
        if I don't know or hit a wall, being able to realise this is just an
        obstacle that I will overcome, I just need to engage in more practice.
        Practice is one I am really going to try hammer home even after this
        course. Doing this is going to help me strengthen those connections and
        ultimately make me a better coder. Knowing this content actually gives
        me a lot of self confidence going forward, knowing that I can get better
        I just got to put my mind to it.
