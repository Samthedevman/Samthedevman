      <h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h2>
      <p>
        Lets first learn what they are. Margin, border and padding are styling
        tools to manipulate the style of an element using CSS. An element is a
        piece of code within HTML, with HTML being the structure of every
        website. Have a look at the image below, this is called the box model.
      </p>
      <img id="boxModelImage" src="../blogcontent/boxmodel.jpeg" />
      <p>
        The margin represents the space surrounding the element outside of the
        border (in this example, content represents the element we are styling).
        Borders are borders around an element, in this example it is a green
        border. The padding represents the space inbetween the border and the
        element we are styling. At first the difference between margin and
        padding can be confusing, especially when there is no border. They are
        both used to make spaces between things like the border and other
        elements. Margin, padding and borders can be added to all four sides of
        an element or just one, the power is in the developers hands. Lets run
        through some examples.
      </p>
      <div class="htmlCssExample1vw">
        <img src="../blogcontent/nftexample.avif" />
        <img src="../blogcontent/nftexample.avif" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Here are two pictures of the same nft above, they are both 1 element
        each. They are spaced apart from each other using margin. The margin in
        this example is 1vw (vw stands for viewport width, 1vw = 1% of a screens
        width, vw margins help keep websites responsive, no matter what device
        someone may be viewing this site on). Lets see what it would look like
        if we tripled this margin.
      </p>

      <div class="htmlCssExample3vw">
        <img src="../blogcontent/nftexample.avif" />
        <img src="../blogcontent/nftexample.avif" />
      </div>
      <p>
        As you can tell above its a much bigger gap between the images. Lets
        look at the code.
      </p>
      <div class="htmlCssExampleCode">
        <img src="../blogcontent/htmlcsscodeexample.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        This snapshot of code was taken from the css file that styles this page.
        The top block of code represents the 1vw margin applied to the left and
        right of the image and the bottom block of code represents the vw margin
        after it has been tripled. So you may be thinking the gap between the
        first two images is 1vw but its actually 2vw this is because we have
        applied margin to the left and right of each image(element), with the
        latter example images(elements) gap being 6vw.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alright lets look at an example of padding. I have added red borders to
        the images below just to make it a bit easier to see the difference.
      </p>
      <div class="htmlCssExample3vwBorders">
        <img src="../blogcontent/nftexample.avif" />
        <img
          class="htmlCssPaddingExample"
          src="../blogcontent/nftexample.avif"
        />
        <p>
          The image(element) above on the right has had a padding
          of 1vw applied to all four sides. The image(element) is still the same
          size, but now with padding, its pushed the boarders 1vw out on each
          side. Lets look at the code for both the css and html this time.
        </p>
        <div class="htmlCssExampleCode">
          <img src="../blogcontent/htmlcssbordersandpaddingexample.png" />
          <img src="../blogcontent/htmlcsshtmlexample.png" />
        </div>
        <p>
          Look at the css in the example image above on the left. In the
          top block of code, we can see it has the border applied to it, the
          border being 1px solid red. The block of code on the bottom represents
          the padding being applied to the right image(element) from the
          previous example. Now lets look at the code in the image on the right.
          This is html. We are using the html to our advantage here to only
          style the right image with padding. This is done so using the class
          name .htmlCssPaddingExample. <!--Class names are ways assign css to
          elements, and looking at our html example, the bottom image code has
          this class applied to it. The code in the css is styling  -->
        </p>
        <p>
          We could go more indepth about class names and html structure, but this post is just about sheding some light on the difference between margin, border and padding.
