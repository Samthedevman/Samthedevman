      <h2>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I would say getting the covid vaccinations was one for me. The values
        that went into this decision for me would have been contribution, doing
        my part to mitigate the spread of covid at the time, courage as the
        vaccines do not have longterm safety data, this was a big one for me as
        I was against getting it for quite sometime for this reason. Freedom.
        Due to the unethical way non-vaxers were treated (I believe in the
        personal choice and the right to unrestricted movement as a human
        right), I did not want to be restricted in my freedom to do things, like
        going to a gym, taking part in activities that are part of normal day
        life, being able to travel out of Auckland if I wanted etc. And lastly
        safety, not for me, but for those around me, my family, collegues and
        society. I would hate to think that I could possibly pass it on to
        someone and for that to have dire consequences. These values were a big
        contributing factor in my decision to get it. I reflect on this with
        mixed feelings if I am honest. I do not want to go down a rabbit hole
        with this topic, Anyway, I feel I made the right decision at the time
        based on the info we were told.

      <h2>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I come from a small family and we live on a lifestyle block so there is
        lots of upkeep to do. Being cooperative was always something my parents
        have instilled in me and my brother since me were young. A task can be a
        lot smaller if everyone helps out and does their part. Another one that
        is a big value of mine is honesty. It really surprises me when people
        say one thing and do the opposite, I am a big believer of keeping your
        word. I can't really pinpoint where this comes from, I guess it is the
        people I have grew up with but I know it's a big part of my identity and
        a core value of mine. Authenticity, I believe in being a genuine good
        bloke and true to myself. Not acting like someone I am not. I feel like
        this is one of my main values I pride myself on, again an influence from
        the environment around me and how I was raised.

      <h2>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am reliable and keep my word. I think this will be helpful during
        collaboration with others in the course. I can be counted on to do my
        part and welcome the collaboration part of the course. I would say I am
        conscientious and a perfectionist. This can also be a limitation of
        mine, but overall, I like to think I get tasks done they way they are
        asked and to the best of my ability, tackle them with pride and not just
        doing the minimum, going above and beyond. I feel this will help me
        develop good relationships with other people on this journey with me and
        make me a good team player in the collaborative tasks. Curiosity. I find
        if I enjoy something I am eager to know the ins and outs of that
        particular thing. In terms of it supporting my learning journey, I am
        already hooked on how rewarding coding can be, this I feel, will help me
        get a lot out of this courses content. I think these strengths lend
        themself well to the coding environment and am eager to put them to the
        test.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h2>
      <p>
        One limitation would be engagement. I find if a work task isn't
        engaging/fun (same for learning) I tend to zone out a bit. In term of
        affecting my journey here, I would say the flipped learning is going to
        quell this behaviour but in saying that I guess I will find out. I have
        always had a passion for tech, so curiosity is on my side for this
        course. I would say I am quite spontaneous and a risk taker. I can
        change my mind a lot when it comes to certain things. For this journey I
        strive to slow down, break things up into smaller steps so I don't miss
        things trying to charge full speed for the end goal, having a plan and
        structure in place to help with my time management. I do lean more
        towards an independent nature, in saying that I am still a good team
        player. I like knowing that if something has not been achieved/the
        outcome, it's on me. Problem solving is part of coding which I welcome
        and will do my best to solve myself but at the same time not feel afraid
        to ask for help if I am truly stuck. Im a perfectionist at heart and
        with this comes the idea of time management. I find I will sink a lot of
        time into things to perfect them. With this course I need to stick to
        the learning outcomes and what is being asked and not sinking a lot of
        time into something that isn't going to help me progress/get me a better
        mark.

      <h2>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h2>
      <p>
        One of my past jobs was replenishment supervisor with Mitre 10 looking
        after a team of about 4 full timers and 10-12 part timers. This role
        came about during a restructure in the business due to covid. A lot of
        peers in my team were a bit bitter about having their hours changed/cut
        by the company and were not in the mood to work productively, this is
        where I met some resistance. In efforts to keep people motivated I would
        always commend good work and good work ethic, there was a cafe in store
        and us leaders were given coffee cards to reward our team with where we
        saw fit. I would use those as a little reward for people I saw who were
        putting in the effort. I also had people working in peers and taking
        responsibility for certain areas of the store. Giving them a bit of
        responsibility I feel helped and working in peers help build a strong
        team. Looking back I probably would have pushed for more 1 on 1 meetings
        with the team, this would have help me figure out everyones strengths
        and weaknesses more and helped me adjust my approach individually. At
        the time this wasn't really fesiable due to team members only working 4
        hours and being overwhelmed with a big work load and not many being
        allowed to be rostered on at one given time. I was following advice from
        given from the store managers, the structure was all new to us at the
        time but yeah looking back, more 1 on 1 time would have been a good
        strategy. This leads to my next strategy which would have been to try
        and motivate individuals who didn't want to give an honest days work,
        try and tweak there perspective a wee bit, and to see the big picture of
        what we were trying to achieve as a team.
