      <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
      <h3>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p>
        Curiosity. I am so eager to learn more about coding, that lends itself
        to keeping me engaged with the content of the course. I am looking to
        get the most out of it and change careers, so the learning has a purpose
        behind it for me which is also a good help. A past limitation of mine
        was procrastination, I would leave assignments till the last minute, and
        then stress and panic to get them done. I have not come across that yet
        with this course and I would say that is due to the engaging content,
        but it's something I am aware of and keeping a mental note on.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I would like to develop my self discipline when it comes to learning a
        bit more, making sure I keep putting in the hours to get the most out of
        this course. I also want to develop my ability to push through obstacles
        no matter how confusing they are, and ultimately solve them myself.
        Logical thinking, I feel this course will help me grow in this area.
        Asking myself questions as to why something is happening and what can be
        done to remedy it, getting myself unstuck and developing my problem
        solving skills.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
        work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
        industry/community representatives What you will do when things are
        building up and starting to get to you
      </h3>
      <p>
        I will endeavour to keep things in perspective, when the course gets
        hard, keeping a mental note that it isn't forever, and that my future
        self will applaud me for persavering. Working with others is a big part
        of being a developer, with this in mind I will strive to be a good team
        player and offer my assistance to those who need help, and also not be
        afraid to reach out and ask for help if I find I am truely stuck on
        something and its taking away precious time I don't have. Being
        flexible, being able to adapt and fit in with other peoples schedules
        and changes we may agree/disagree on within group collaboration. Keeping
        a mental note that we are all on the journey together and we can all
        help each other to succeed.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h3>
      <p>
        If I am going way above the time box schedule because I am truely stuck
        on something, then I will ask for help. It really depends on the task
        and what it is, but I would reach out in the discord channel. If I don't
        understand a concept and still can't get the answer that I'm looking for
        online, again reaching out in the discord, maybe someone else's
        perspective will help bridge the gap for me and that concept I am not
        getting. This also comes back to framing to question correctly, making
        it easier for my peers/facilitators to help and not take up a lot of
        there time just trying to understand where I am stuck if that happens.
      </p>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p>
        I would like them to not just solve a problem for us if they are helping
        us, but more act as a guide to help grow our problem solving skills and
        logical thinking.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Not really. The only thing I would say is I am a night owl. When it
        comes to group collaboration, if the timing isn't right, I will adjust
        sleeping patterns to suit.
