      <h2>Learning Plan - Bootcamp</h2>
      <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        I would like to get a web developer job straight after course, to keep
        my skills up to date and to keep learning coding, get back in the
        workforce... No destination in mind but I would like to work for a big
        development company one day, IBM?. I wont be accepting anything that
        isnt a developer job, if there is any down time, inbetween course and
        getting a job it will be dedicated to learning more and becoming a
        better coder and searching for a web developer job. I would like to
        leave my mark on a development company who is good to work for, and give
        the job my all.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The more I've been coding the more I like it. I find it so rewarding
        when your able to problem solve and get something working, even when you
        had no idea how to do it a hour beforehand. I am still so curious, and I
        really want to learn the ins and outs of Javascript. In terms of
        procrastination I mentioned in sprint 2s post, I havent really felt
        that. Foundations has been alot of fun and rewarding, nothing has really
        felt like a chore, and coding feels like a game to me. I would say my
        biggest strength is still curiosity. I know bootcamp is going to get
        intense, I would say a limitation may be trying to remember the flood of
        information each day, week. Its alot to take in, something I am
        preparing myself mentally for.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h3>
      <p>
        For this I would have to say keeping up with the work load, I know I
        will be able to do it, I will be keeping alot of notes. I dont want to
        rush through a concept and move on without fully understanding it. I am
        not the greatest speaker when the attention is on me, but I look forward
        to improving this skill during the course as I feel it will be needed in
        a web developer job. 9 weeks, it is a stretch, but one I welcome, it
        will definitely be a challenge staying focused and absorbing everything,
        I feel the workload may get tough at times, but its good knowing there
        is support for us during the course.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Definitely would like to develop my self awareness and emotional
        intelligence skills. I think these are important for being a developer
        and also being a better person. Improving my communication if I am not
        okay with something is also something I would like to improve, not just
        sitting back and going with the flow, but voicing my opinions and to reach a
        compromise that everyone is happy with. I look forward to the group and
        pair work, really want to see how everyone else approaches problems, I
        feel I will be a good team player, I would like to develop that skills
        even more aswell as my leadership skills. I enjoy criticism, without it,
        I feel its hard to get a real perspective on how I can improve. I want
        to take onboard anything that comes my way and do my best to amend it.
      </p>
      <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
      <p>
        I would like to think the course is going to have a good balance of fun
        and problem solving needed to make us better developers. In terms of
        support, I think just knowing its there for alot of people is a good
        boost, I know it will be for me. Extra time for things if needed, I feel
        is good support but also not being too leanient. Fairness above all, I feel is an expectation.
      </p>
      <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
      <p>
        To be completely honest, I feel my answer is still the same as it was
        with sprint 2's post. If a concept comes my way, and time is tight and I
        have not fully understood it before moving on, I will seek advice in the
        discord or from facilitators. I plan to keep a schedule through out the
        bootcamp, allocating time for breaks and rest at specific times. I want
        to give this 9 weeks my all and I think this kind of schduling will help
        not only me but my peers I will be collaborating with, I feel it will
        make me a better team player overall.

      <h2>Learning Plan - Foundations</h2>
      <h3>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p>
        Curiosity. I am so eager to learn more about coding, that lends itself
        to keeping me engaged with the content of the course. I am looking to
        get the most out of it and change careers, so the learning has a purpose
        behind it for me which is also a good help. A past limitation of mine
        was procrastination, I would leave assignments till the last minute, and
        then stress and panic to get them done. I have not come across that yet
        with this course and I would say that is due to the engaging content,
        but it's something I am aware of and keeping a mental note on.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I would like to develop my self discipline when it comes to learning a
        bit more, making sure I keep putting in the hours to get the most out of
        this course. I also want to develop my ability to push through obstacles
        no matter how confusing they are, and ultimately solve them myself.
        Logical thinking, I feel this course will help me grow in this area.
        Asking myself questions as to why something is happening and what can be
        done to remedy it, getting myself unstuck and developing my problem
        solving skills.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
        work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
        industry/community representatives What you will do when things are
        building up and starting to get to you
      </h3>
      <p>
        I will endeavour to keep things in perspective, when the course gets
        hard, keeping a mental note that it isn't forever, and that my future
        self will applaud me for persavering. Working with others is a big part
        of being a developer, with this in mind I will strive to be a good team
        player and offer my assistance to those who need help, and also not be
        afraid to reach out and ask for help if I find I am truely stuck on
        something and its taking away precious time I don't have. Being
        flexible, being able to adapt and fit in with other peoples schedules
        and changes we may agree/disagree on within group collaboration. Keeping
        a mental note that we are all on the journey together and we can all
        help each other to succeed.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h3>
      <p>
        If I am going way above the time box schedule because I am truely stuck
        on something, then I will ask for help. It really depends on the task
        and what it is, but I would reach out in the discord channel. If I don't
        understand a concept and still can't get the answer that I'm looking for
        online, again reaching out in the discord, maybe someone else's
        perspective will help bridge the gap for me and that concept I am not
        getting. This also comes back to framing to question correctly, making
        it easier for my peers/facilitators to help and not take up a lot of
        there time just trying to understand where I am stuck if that happens.
      </p>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p>
        I would like them to not just solve a problem for us if they are helping
        us, but more act as a guide to help grow our problem solving skills and
        logical thinking.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Not really. The only thing I would say is I am a night owl. When it
        comes to group collaboration, if the timing isn't right, I will adjust
        sleeping patterns to suit.
